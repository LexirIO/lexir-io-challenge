## Run Code
- yarn install
- yarn run dev

## Decisions
- They are mostly UI layout and not Functional at the moment and the header which is a multi nested menu is just a html layout but it is currently being worked on just to get a better understanding of how it will work. 


## Suggestions
- The mobile UI wasn't provided if it is required maybe is should be (as i only worked on the web).
