The solution I decided was to build the project with React, JavaScript and Tailwind. I have not used TypeScript since I never used it and I do not have the time to learn it in 2 days.
I simulated an api call with a promise with a delay of 1.5s. I show a “Loading” when the products are not in the application and once I have all the products from the “api” I show them. This was my first time using Tailwind css and I admit, everything was so much quicker and easier.

I hope my code is in your interest and I am here willing to learn and be a front here assassin hero.
