# Running the code

While running the code there should be no errors.

# Decisions taken

## Languages

**TypeScript**: It's been a challenge for me because I've never really used it (maybe twice when I was learning Angular) and it was something I was planning to learn.

**Tailwind**: It was also a challenge and something I had planned because I was tired of using bootstrap.

## Components

I decided to create and use different components to reduce the size of the index.tsx and avoid code repetition.

## Icons

Using font awesome icons it's been really easy to configure and use and therefore I had no need to download anything.

# Suggestions

In the repo I forked the folders `/components` and `/assets` were not in it.

# Other comments

I decided to do the Billing profile page because I think it's one of the challenging pages (not the most difficult nor the easier).

It's made for an invented online plants shop because I love plants 🪴 (In that way you'll know me a bit more).

I think the tech stack you work with (and encourage us to do the challenge with) it's really modern and more user friendly than others out there.

I've learned a lot and really enjoyed the process of doing this challenge 👨‍💻

From my point of view it came out really nice so I hope you like it! 🙃
